🌐 TCP/IP & OSI Model Diagrams

This section breaks down how networks communicate using layered models. It includes simplified definitions, diagrams, protocol examples, real-world troubleshooting, and tools to help you visualize data flow and diagnose problems.
🧩 Definitions

OSI Model: A conceptual 7-layer framework that describes how data travels from one device to another across a network.

TCP/IP Model: A 4- or 5-layer practical implementation of network communication used on the internet.
💡 Explanation (Layman's Terms)

    Think of the OSI model like a postal system:

        Each layer has a job: preparing, packaging, addressing, sending, delivering, and opening a letter.

    TCP/IP: It’s like a simplified version of OSI used in real-life systems (email, websites, streaming).

🧱 OSI Model Layers (Top → Bottom)
Layer	Name	Function	Example Protocols
7	Application	Interface for user apps	HTTP, FTP, DNS
6	Presentation	Data formatting/encryption	SSL/TLS, JPEG
5	Session	Start/stop/manage connections	NetBIOS, RPC
4	Transport	Reliable delivery (segments)	TCP, UDP
3	Network	Logical addressing and routing	IP, ICMP, ARP
2	Data Link	Physical addressing (MAC)	Ethernet, PPP
1	Physical	Transmission of bits	Cables, NICs
📦 TCP/IP Layers
Layer	OSI Equivalent	Example Protocols
Application	Layers 5–7	HTTP, DNS, SMTP
Transport	Layer 4	TCP, UDP
Internet	Layer 3	IP, ICMP
Network	Layers 1–2 (Link + Phys.)	Ethernet, ARP
🛠 Real-World Scenario & Fixes
Scenario: Website not loading

    Check Layer 7 (Application): Try another website

    Check Layer 3 (Network): Run ping google.com

    Check Layer 2 (Link): Is Ethernet cable unplugged?

Scenario: DNS not resolving

    Layer 7: App issue?

    Layer 4: Try netstat

    Layer 3: Use nslookup or dig to verify DNS

🧪 Diagnostic Tools & Commands
Tool/Command	Purpose	Layer(s) Targeted
ping	Check connectivity	Layer 3
traceroute	Show path across networks	Layers 3–4
netstat	View open ports/connections	Layer 4
nslookup	Diagnose DNS resolution	Layer 7
ipconfig / ifconfig	View interface settings	Layer 2–3
🧩 Component Usage & Issues
Component	Use Case	Common Issues	Fix
Router	IP routing between networks	Routing loop, IP conflict	Reset routes, DHCP check
Switch	Direct traffic via MAC	Broadcast storm	Enable STP, check loops
NIC	Interface to network	Driver error, unplugged cable	Reinstall drivers, check cable
DNS Server	Resolve domain names	Cache issues, unresponsive	Flush DNS, change server
🧠 Quick Mnemonics

    OSI (top to bottom):
    All People Seem To Need Data Processing

    TCP/IP Order:
    Application → Transport → Internet → Network
