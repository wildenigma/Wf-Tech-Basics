üíª Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

This section explains the fundamentals and real-world applications of desktop and server operating systems from a help desk and infrastructure support lens.

üß© Definitions

Operating System (OS): Software that manages computer hardware and provides services for applications.

Windows: Widely-used OS with GUI, active in enterprise, education, and consumer environments.

Linux: Open-source OS known for security and flexibility. Popular in servers, cybersecurity, and DevOps.

macOS: Apple‚Äôs UNIX-based OS known for user-friendly design and creative tools.

üí° Explanation (Layman's Terms)

An operating system is like a translator between your hardware and your apps. Without it, your computer wouldn‚Äôt understand commands or run software.

Windows: Like driving an automatic car‚Äîdesigned for ease and automation.

Linux: More like a manual transmission‚Äîflexible, but you do more hands-on.

macOS: Smooth interface with tight control and integration across Apple hardware.
